# GraphAPI Documentation

## [Graph API Reference](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference)

This is a full list of the Graph API root nodes such as `comment, debug_token, post, profile and so on`. The main difference between a root node and a non-root node is that root nodes can be queried directly, while non-root nodes can be queried via root nodes or edges. If you want to learn how to use the Graph API, read our [Using Graph API guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview), and if you want to know which APIs can solve some frequent issues, try our [Common Scenarios guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api).

## [Paginated Results](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/results)

We cover the basics of Graph API terminology and structure in the Graph API overview. This document goes into more detail about the results from your API requests.

## [Page Public Content Access](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/features-reference/page-public-content-access)

The Page Public Content Access feature allows an app access to the Pages Search API and to read public data for Pages

## [Page Public Metadata Access](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/features-reference/page-public-metadata-access)

The allowed usage for this feature is to analyze engagement with public Pages by viewing Like and follower counts, or aggregate public-facing About Page information from multiple, disparate pages.

## [Page Mentioning](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/features-reference/page-mentioning)

The Page Mentioning feature allows your app mention any Facebook Page when publishing posts on the Pages managed by your app.

## [Permissions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions)

Apps request specific [permissions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions) to access specific parts of Facebook Graph data.

## [Rate Limits](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/rate-limiting)

**Note:: Still Reading**

A rate limit is the number of API calls an app or user can make within a given time period. If this limit is exceeded or if CPU or total time limits are exceeded, the app or user may be throttled. API requests made by a throttled user or app will fail.
